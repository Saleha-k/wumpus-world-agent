WUMPUS WORLD - Knowledge-Based Agent
An intelligent agent that navigates the Wumpus World environment using propositional logic and resolution-based inference to make safe decisions.

📋 Overview
The Wumpus World is a classic AI problem where an agent must navigate a cave filled with pits and a deadly Wumpus creature. This implementation features a knowledge-based agent that uses logical inference to deduce safe paths and avoid hazards. The agent never relies on luck - every move is justified by logical deduction from its percepts.

✨ Features
Knowledge-Based Agent: Uses propositional logic to maintain and reason about world knowledge
Resolution Inference: Implements resolution refutation for logical entailment
Real-time Visualization: Interactive grid display showing agent position, visited cells, and percepts
Multiple Control Modes: Manual step-by-step or autonomous exploration
Performance Metrics: Tracks inference steps, resolution calls, visited cells, and score
Percept Tracking: Displays breeze and stench detection at each visited cell
Configurable World: Adjustable grid size and number of pits
🎮 How It Works
Agent Logic
Perception: Agent detects BREEZE (adjacent pit) and STENCH (adjacent Wumpus) at current cell
Knowledge Update: Percepts are added to Knowledge Base as logical clauses
Inference: Resolution algorithm queries safe neighboring cells
Decision: Agent moves to a proven safe cell or explores frontier if no safe cell is proven
Logical Rules
B(i,j) → ∃ adjacent P(i,j) (Breeze implies adjacent pit) S(i,j) → ∃ adjacent W(i,j) (Stench implies adjacent Wumpus) ¬B(i,j) → ∀ adjacent ¬P(i,j) (No breeze means no adjacent pits) ¬S(i,j) → ∀ adjacent ¬W(i,j) (No stench means no adjacent Wumpus) Safe(i,j) → ¬P(i,j) ∧ ¬W(i,j) (Safe means no pit and no Wumpus)

Fall back to closest frontier if no safe cells proven
